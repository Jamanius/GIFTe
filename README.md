Promoting the GiftEconomy 

> “You make a living from what you get, 
> but you make a life from what you give”

*GiftE offers an alternative to monetary exchange where goods and services are gifted to people in your local community without contemplation of reciprocity.  It's like a TradeMe for free stuff, shared between people in your neighbourhood.*
